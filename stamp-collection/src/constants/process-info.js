  "A featured stamp is hand-selected from the top category of each decade to visualize the top themes and historical context by removing the background and zooming in on the mark. As you interact and explore, the feature continues to reflect the top category with an image cropped to the first stamp detected by <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.36.0/en/model_doc/owlv2\" target=\"_blank\">OWLv2</a>. The stamps below are sorted by their visual similarity to each updated feature, made possible by processing each artifact's thumbnail image using <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/google/siglip2-giant-opt-patch16-256\" target=\"_blank\">SigLIP</a> to extract image embeddings."
