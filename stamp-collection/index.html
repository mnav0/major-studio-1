          <h1>America's Stamp Collection</h1>
           <p class="subheading">In 1765, The Stamp Act was part of a series of taxes imposed by the British government on American colonies and became key to the King and Parliament declaring full control over the colonies. Colonists strongly opposed this tax that required them to pay the British government for all postage of letters, newspapers, etc. via government-purchased stamps, which became an early symbol of resistance that we can use to trace a path from this pre-revolutionary era through to the beginning of the American Revolution, and ultimately to today.</p>
