# America's Stamp Collection
_Maggie Navracruz_

This project explores how we can trace a path through history using the National Postal Museum's collection of stamps and letters - from the first stamp as part of The Stamp Act of 1765 to where they begin to live more permanently in America's modern day postal system and culture. Categorized by decade from 1760 to 1890, themes, colors and imagery are extracted and supplemented with historical context to explore how their history laid the foundation for stamps to become a symbol of resistance, revolutionary spirit, and independence.
